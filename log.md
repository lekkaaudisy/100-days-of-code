# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I worked on setting up the project structure for the Todo App. I created the HTML structure, added basic styling with CSS, and implemented the functionality to add new tasks to the list.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start this challenge and work on this project. The Todo App is a great way to practice my web development skills and learn more about JavaScript.
