# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I worked on setting up the project structure for the Todo App. I created the HTML structure, added basic styling with CSS, and implemented the functionality to add new tasks to the list.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start this challenge and work on this project. The Todo App is a great way to practice my web development skills and learn more about JavaScript.

### Day 2: January 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I worked on setting up the project structure for the card layout, and the progress made includes adding rounded corners, adjusting margins, and positioning the button at the bottom of the subscription article while taking up the full width through the CSS code.

**Thoughts:** I need to ensure that my project adheres to web accessibility standards.
